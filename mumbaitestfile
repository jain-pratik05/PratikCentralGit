Git is a Software and github is remote repository. you download git on ine. once downloaded you create a folder and then run init git on it to make that folder as repository. once done, you create a file within same. then you add and commit. 
then you add origin i.e. remote repo URL where you want to send the file. once added, you push to that remote repo location.
